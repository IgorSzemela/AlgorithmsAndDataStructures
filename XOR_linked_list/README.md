# XOR_linked_list
During adding a new node to the list, we write the xor value of the predecessor and the successor to this node. If it is the first or the last node, as the xor of addresses, we write the address of the successor or the predecessor, respectively, because the address xor with 0 (we take zero as NULL) does not change the address value. From this it follows that we need to store a pointer to the first and last element of the list, which will allow us to browse the list in both directions. If we want to go to the next node in the assumed direction, we read its address as xor values stored in the current and previously visited node. As described earlier, at the boundary node this will be the direct address (since the value of a hypothetical nonexistent earlier node is 0).

In the case of deleting a node, updating the xor values of the deleted node's predecessor and successor is required. When deleting an boundary node, there is only one neighbor that needs to be updated.
